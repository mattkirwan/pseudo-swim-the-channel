#Pseudo Swim The Channel

From Monday the 1st of July I'll be swimming, at least, every workday until Friday the 30th of August.

To be honest, I'm a bit rubbish as this excerise lark, so I've set myself a target of swimming the distance between Dover and Calais during this period.

Initial figures, worked out on the way to the office, indicate this distance to be ~40KM. So, given there are 45 workday in the aforementioned period I have to swim ~35 (25M) lengths in each session.

I'll be swimming at [Northumbia University](http://www.nusportcentral.com/) during my lunchbreak, so I'll have about 20 minutes to swim 35 lengths - that's about 1,600 lengths in 900 minutes.

Thankfully, [Northumbia University](http://www.nusportcentral.com/) is only short distance away from [Drummond Central](http://drummondcentral.co.uk/) so I'll not have far to stumble back.

You can see how I'm getting on, if you're that interested, using this handy dandy [status.geojson](status.geojson) file.

If I manage to find some time this weekend, I'll record my times and distances with [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/AnthonySterling) and then use this data to automatically update the [status.geojson](status.geojson) file with my progress.

Anthony.
